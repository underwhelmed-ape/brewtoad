# brewtoad

Brewtoad is a large platform for the homebrewing community.

This has amassed over 500,000 community shared recipes for beer, but have recently announced they will be shutting down, removing access to this collection.

This script will run through the pages, identifying the 'download xml' link and save the file locally.

This does not provide all information found on the site, just the recipe. There this script will also scrape information from the site page as well.
